# HexDumb
An esoteric language written in Lua

# What is HexDumb
It is an esoteric language I wrote in Lua. As the pun in the name suggests, you code with 2-digit hexadecimals. HexDumb works like some variants of assembly languages.
```
# A Hello World program in HexDumb #
40 48 40 45 40 4C 40 4C 40 4F 40 20 40 57 40 4F 40 52 40 4C 40 44
```

## Features
### Call Stack
The program that is run and interpreted by HexDumb is called the Call Stack. Call Stack contains the instruction calls and values needed by the program. The Call Stack also serves as the memory stack of the program, which makes HexDumb a reflective esoteric language: a language that allows you to modify itself on runtime.
### Registers
Just like Assembly variants, HexDumb uses registers. There 4(or 5, depends on how you interpret it) registers: A, B, C, D and Accumulator. These registers handle bytes separate from the call stack.
### Memoization
All instructions that transforms the value memoizes the output i.e. Bitwise instructions.
